#adapt-contrib-graphic

A component for the Adapt Framework that dynamically displays image of different resolutions based upon device width.  

Three image widths from the _AdaptBuilder.screenSize_ object are handled:
* small
* large

In order to render images, these three corresponding data attributes in the JSON must be set to the source of the various images.
* _data-small_
* _data-large_

When the viewport size changes, these attributes will be swapped.

##Installation

        adapt install adapt-contrib-graphic

This component can also be installed by adding the component to the adapt.json file before running `adapt install`:

        "adapt-contrib-graphic": "*"
